  - **Security:** Ask, “How would you secure this endpoint to ensure only authenticated users can add a user?”
    - Look for: Mention of Spring Security, JWT, or OAuth for authentication.

- **Evaluation Tips:**
  - A strong candidate will write a functional Spring Boot REST API, handle validation and errors, and demonstrate knowledge of persistence and security.

#### Question 7 (Problem-Solving): Write a Java program to design a simple REST API endpoint using Spring Boot that accepts a POST request to add a new user to a list and returns the updated list of users.

  - **Security:** Ask, “How would you secure this endpoint to ensure only authenticated users can add a user?”
    - Look for: Mention of Spring Security, JWT, or OAuth for authentication.

- **Evaluation Tips:**
  - A strong candidate will write a functional Spring Boot REST API, handle validation and errors, and demonstrate knowledge of persistence and security.

- **Sample Code:**
  ```java
  import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
  import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
  import javax.validation.Valid;
  import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
  import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  import java.util.List;

  @SpringBootApplication
  @RestController
  @RequestMapping("/api/users")
  public class UserApplication {

      private List<String> users = new ArrayList<>();

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          SpringApplication.run(UserApplication.class, args);
      }

      // POST endpoint to add a new user
      @PostMapping
      public ResponseEntity<List<String>> addUser(@Valid @RequestBody UserRequest userRequest) {
          if (userRequest.getName() == null || userRequest.getName().trim().isEmpty()) {
              return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
          }
          if (!userRequest.getName().matches("[a-zA-Z ]+")) {
              return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
          }
          users.add(userRequest.getName());
          return new ResponseEntity<>(users, HttpStatus.CREATED);
      }

      // GET endpoint to return the list of users
      @GetMapping
      public List<String> getUsers() {
          return users;
      }
  }

  // Request DTO with validation
  class UserRequest {
      private String name;

      public String getName() {
          return name;
      }

      public void setName(String name) {
          this.name = name;
      }
  }
```

#### Notes:
- This is a basic in-memory implementation using a `List<String>` for simplicity.
- Validation checks for non-empty names and restricts special characters (using a basic regex `[a-zA-Z ]+`).
- Returns HTTP 201 (Created) on success or 400 (Bad Request) on validation failure.
- For persistence, he could replace the `List<String>` with a Spring Data JPA repository and entity (e.g., `@Entity User` with `@Id` and `@Column` annotations, and a `UserRepository` extending `JpaRepository`).
- For error handling, he could add a global `@ExceptionHandler` or use `@ControllerAdvice` to handle exceptions uniformly.
- For security, he could integrate Spring Security with `@PreAuthorize` or JWT authentication by adding dependencies and configuring a security filter.

#### Evaluation Tips (Repeated for Context):
- A strong candidate will write a functional Spring Boot REST API, handle validation and errors, and demonstrate knowledge of persistence and security.

#### Question 10: Write a Java program to find the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.

- **What to Probe:**
  - **Approach Explanation:** After he writes the code, ask, “Can you explain your approach and why you chose it?”
    - Look for: Use of a sliding window technique with a HashSet, and a clear explanation of the algorithm (O(n) time complexity).
  - **Edge Cases:** Ask, “How does your solution handle edge cases like an empty string or a string with all identical characters (e.g., ‘aaaa’)?”
    - Look for: Proper handling (e.g., empty string returns “”, “aaaa” returns “a”).
  - **Optimization:** Ask, “Can you think of a way to optimize this solution further, either in terms of time or space complexity?”
    - Look for: Discussion of space optimization (e.g., using an array instead of a HashSet for ASCII characters) or alternative approaches.
  - **Alternative Solutions:** Ask, “What if you needed to return all longest substrings without repeating characters, not just one? How would you modify your code?”
    - Look for: Storing all substrings of the maximum length in a list.

- **Evaluation Tips:**
  - A strong candidate will write a correct solution, explain their approach clearly, handle edge cases, and discuss optimizations or alternatives.


### Set 4: Technical Deep Dive (Databases - DBMS/MySQL)

**Goal:** Assess Akash’s database skills with a mix of easy and hard questions, focusing on MySQL and DBMS concepts.

#### Question 8 (Easy): What’s the difference between a primary key and a foreign key in a database? Can you give an example from your Online Food Ordering System project?

- **What to Probe:**
  - **Conceptual Understanding:** If he explains the difference (primary key uniquely identifies a row, foreign key links tables), ask, “What happens if you try to insert a foreign key value that doesn’t exist in the referenced table?”
    - Look for: Understanding of referential integrity (e.g., the insert will fail due to a constraint violation).
  - **Practical Example:** Ask, “In your Online Food Ordering System, how did you use primary and foreign keys in your database schema?”
    - Look for: A schema example (e.g., `Orders` table with `order_id` as primary key, `user_id` as foreign key referencing `Users` table).
  - **Indexes:** Ask, “Are primary keys automatically indexed? What about foreign keys?”
    - Look for: Primary keys are indexed, foreign keys are not always indexed (depends on the DBMS, e.g., MySQL doesn’t auto-index foreign keys).

- **Evaluation Tips:**
  - A strong answer will cover the differences, provide a project-specific example, and show awareness of indexing.

#### Question 9 (Hard): Design a database schema for your Online Food Ordering System and write a MySQL query to find the top 5 most ordered items in the last 30 days.

- **What to Probe:**
  - **Schema Design:** After he designs the schema, ask, “Why did you structure the tables this way? How does your design ensure data integrity?”
    - Look for: Tables like `Users`, `Orders`, `Order_Items`, `Items`, with proper primary and foreign keys, and normalization (e.g., 3NF).
    - **Sample Schema:**
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE Users (
          user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
          username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
          email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
      );

      CREATE TABLE Items (
          item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
          item_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
          price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
      );

      CREATE TABLE Orders (
          order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
          user_id INT,
          order_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
          FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
      );

```

- **Query Writing:** After he writes the query, ask, “Can you explain your query and its performance implications?”
  - Look for: A correct query using JOINs, GROUP BY, and date filtering (O(n) time depending on indexes).
  - **Sample Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT i.item_name, SUM(oi.quantity) as total_ordered
    FROM Items i
    JOIN Order_Items oi ON i.item_id = oi.item_id
    JOIN Orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
    WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
    GROUP BY i.item_id, i.item_name
    ORDER BY total_ordered DESC
    LIMIT 5;
```
- **Optimization:** Ask, “How would you optimize this query for a large dataset?”
  - Look for: Adding indexes on `order_date`, `item_id`, and `order_id` to speed up JOINs and filtering.
- **Edge Cases:** Ask, “What if there are no orders in the last 30 days? How does your query handle that?”
  - Look for: Awareness that the query will return an empty result set.

- **Evaluation Tips:**
  - A strong candidate will design a normalized schema, write a correct query, optimize for performance, and handle edge cases.

### Set 5: System Design (FAANG-Style)

**Goal:** Assess Akash’s system design skills with a FAANG-style question, focusing on scalability and real-world applicability.

#### Question 10 (Hard): Design the Online Food Ordering System you built, focusing on scalability for millions of users.

- **What to Probe:**
  - **High-Level Architecture:** Ask, “Can you draw a high-level architecture diagram and explain the components?”
    - Look for: A layered architecture (e.g., Client → Load Balancer → Application Servers → Database → Cache).
    - **Components:**
      - **Client:** Web app (HTML/CSS/JS).
      - **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic (e.g., AWS ELB).
      - **Application Servers:** Java/Spring Boot for APIs (e.g., /order, /menu).
      - **Database:** MySQL for persistent storage, with sharding for scalability.
      - **Cache:** Redis for caching menu items and user sessions.
      - **Message Queue:** Kafka for handling order processing asynchronously.
  - **Scalability:** Ask, “How would you handle a sudden spike in orders during peak hours?”
    - Look for: Auto-scaling application servers, caching frequently accessed data (e.g., menu items), and asynchronous order processing with Kafka.
  - **Database Design:** Ask, “How would you design the database to handle millions of orders without performance degradation?”
    - Look for: Sharding by `user_id` or region, indexing on frequently queried fields, and read replicas for load balancing.
  - **Security:** Ask, “How would you secure this system, especially since you mentioned user authentication and payment processing?”
    - Look for: HTTPS, JWT for authentication, encryption for payment data, and OWASP best practices (relevant to his Network Security Engineer role).
  - **Failure Handling:** Ask, “What happens if an application server fails during an order? How do you ensure the user isn’t charged twice?”
    - Look for: Idempotency in payment APIs, circuit breakers, and retry mechanisms.

- **Evaluation Tips:**
  - A strong candidate will propose a scalable architecture, address performance bottlenecks, ensure security, and handle failures gracefully.

public class LongestSubstring {
    public static String findLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int maxLength = 0;
        int start = 0;

            }
        }
        return s.substring(maxStart, maxStart + maxLength);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "abcabcbb";
